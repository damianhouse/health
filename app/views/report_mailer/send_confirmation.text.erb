Welcome To My HealthStyle !

We are thrilled you’ve chosen to partner with My HealthStyle, Inc. In the next few days and weeks, you
will join a trusted community of kind, supportive coaches and health-oriented peers who all have one
goal - a better healthier life.

What Does A Healthier Life Mean?

At My HealthStyle, Inc., it means no judgement, no agenda and no shame. Your HealthStyle Coaches
are here to guide you to a better, healthier you. That does not mean a 24” waist or running a 5K a week.
That means what YOU need it to be. What works best for you, your life, and your health.
Here, you will be uplifted and supported. Nurtured and awakened. By health guides, not bullies.

How Do My HealthStyle Coaches Help?

Our coaches are licensed and certified in their respective fields, bringing you the knowledge and
experience you can depend on for a personal and meaningful behavioral change. Changes that lead to
lasting weight loss and improved health and well-being.

Soon My HealthStyle, Inc. will alert you via text and email that your HealthStyle Coaches have been
assigned to you. Once you hear from us, log on, and take the first steps to a healthier you.
We can’t wait to take this journey together.

Your Team at My HealthStyle, Inc.
